# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 1, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through [Blade Templates](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/blade).

**Thoughts** I've recently started learning Laravel, and it's a great feeling when I finally managed to understand blade and push my simple app in repo branch after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
